# ML-Prediction-
A HR prediction of the likelihood of Employees leaving or staying at a job.

Here I used both Logistic regression and Random Forrest in training and predicting for my model 

can be used by firms so they can save a lot of money by helping those who are likely to leave the firm stay; thereby saving cost of recruiting new staff and training them.
